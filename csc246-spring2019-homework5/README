Usage of myls:
  $ ./myls
  $ ./myls -l
  $ ./myls OPTIONAL_PATH/
  $ ./myls -l OPTIONAL_PATH/

This program produces a similar output as the built-in Linux "ls" command.
There are two possible types of output: If -l is not present, the program
will list the files and directories in the current path or optional path,
depending on the existence of optional path, and quit. If -l is present,
it will print each file and directory's permission, number of hard links,
owner, group, size, modified date, and file name.
